			<b>What is mindfulness?</b>
		</h2>
	</div>
	<h2 style="color: white;">
		Mindfulness is becoming a “detached observer” of your own body and mind. This means being non-judgmentally aware and accepting of pleasant and unpleasant events, thoughts, sensations, and emotions in the present moment, <b>including the experience of tinnitus.</b>  If you notice your attention shifting to the “there and then” (past memories, future worries), you gently return your focus to the “here and now” (present moment). Mindfulness has long been used in Eastern cultures to promote well-being.

		<b>Everyday Mindfulness:</b> You can practice mindfulness in several ways. One simple way is to intentionally, and non-judgmentally put effort into being aware of what you are doing in the moment, no matter what that is. When you are walking, focus on your walk. When you are cooking, focus on the food--how it smells, tastes, feels etc. When you are talking with a friend, pay full attention to the friend. When a distraction comes to mind, notice it and move your attention back to the present moment. Common distractions include the voice in your head urging you to do work or chores, thoughts about work, and thoughts or feelings about tinnitus. When practicing mindfulness it is normal to need to shift your attention back to the present moment over and over again. As you practice, you will get better at it.
		<br /><br />
		<b>Mindful Breathing:</b> Another way to practice mindfulness is to spend time focusing your attention on breathing. Set aside time to complete this activity without interruption. Find a quiet place to sit and tell other people you need some quiet time alone. Make sure your phone won’t ring. Sit comfortably with your back straight. Close your eyes, and begin to focus on your breathing. Breathe through your nose or your mouth, whatever feels more natural to you. As you focus on your breathing, remind yourself to relax. This exercise should not be a strain. If you find yourself concentrating too hard, then your body may begin to tense up, so relax. If thoughts come into your mind, don’t be too concerned. Allow them. Notice them. Let go of them, and return your awareness to your breathing.  If a thought, memory, or emotion comes up, just notice it in the same way you might notice a parked car while taking a walk. You see it, you accept it, you understand it, but you don’t feel any particular attachment to it. Try this for just five minutes a day. You may wish to increase the time as you get more comfortable with this exercise. This mindfulness activity may seem simple, but it can be very effective. Over time it can help you to become more peaceful. It can train you to let go of troubling thoughts and feelings more easily. Distractions are normal. The point of practicing mindfulness is to learn to deal with these distractions in an accepting and peaceful way.  We do not try to get rid of them or block them out.  No matter what arises while doing this exercise, just observe it and let it go. Distractions are like clouds in the sky. You notice them and then they pass by. They do not remain for long. As soon as you return your attention to your breathing, they begin to drift away or evaporate altogether.

		<b>Guided Meditation:</b>  Guided meditation is a good way to learn to relax. You listen to a voice that will guide you through breathing and mental imagery exercises. There are six different guided meditation exercises that are available for you to use as a part of this program. Each audio recording guides you through a different way of helping the body and mind relax. You can let the recordings lead you through each exercise every time you want to use them. Or, once you are familiar with the exercises, you can practice them on your own. Use these anytime you wish to feel refreshed and relaxed. Below is a description of each guided meditation exercise available.
